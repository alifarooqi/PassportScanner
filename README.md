# PassportScanner
A mobile app that can scan your passport and auto-fill forms for you.

Made during [Cathay Pacific 24-hour Hackathon](https://hackathon.cathaypacific.com/) using React JS. The idea of this app was very simple: to ease the process of Online Check-In. 

Cathay Pacific found out that less than 30% of the passengers use Online Check-In, while rest of them prefers to wait in long queues at the airports to get checked-in. The reason? Mistakes, such as misspelled words or mismatched names in the online check-in forms may cause a lot of trouble. This web app allows you to breeze through the online check-in form without worrying about any mistakes. You scan the first page of your passport* and this App will automatically fill in the check-in information for you.

*We store the image of your passport on the cloud in order to scan it*
